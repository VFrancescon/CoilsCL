# CoilsCL

Develpment repo for closed loop control on the Helmholtz Coils.

Idea is to use magneto-mechanic equilibrium to find a solution for a given shape and then adjust it as required using cameras to close the loop.

## File structure

src/ contains a lot of scripts and utilities, all leading up to ControllerPrototype.cpp, which currently kinda works
